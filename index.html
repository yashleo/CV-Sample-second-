            I am Not a Rapper.It's my favourite hobby.I love to write and listen Rap Songs.It is a Part of Hip-Hop Culture,
            I am very much keen to learn and gather knowledge about Hip-Hop Culture.I learned it by myself wothout any
            training or guidance int the field by any person or a group.It is kind a proud and Auspicious to say 
            that I have already written more than a dozen of rap songs.Even I have also recorded some of them.I feel very 
            good and motivated when I do it.It is kind of Confidence Booster for me,In my Work and also Life Beyond Work.
            I also Like to Dance.I can perform popping Dance style which I also learned by Myself like without a former training
            or guidance Like Rapping.Thank You.
